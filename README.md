# ResourceKit
A Swift-native iOS framework for working with files and file types.

## Installation
I plan to offer in the near future the option to download ResourceKit via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Until then, copy the ResourceKit folder to your Xcode project.  When you do, enable the following options:

1.  **Copy items if needed**
2.  **Create groups**

## Known issues
Currently, there are no known issues.  If you discover any, please kindly submit a [pull reequest](https://github.com/djrlj694/ResourceKit/pull/new/master).

## License
ResourceKit is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
